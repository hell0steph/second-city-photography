		 <h1>Lucas Torres</h1>
		 <p>I am a photographer born, raised and based in Chicago, IL. My passion began with street photography and the unique visual opportunities it presents, but I soon found myself expanding my interests to bring my perspective to portraiture, editorial and events professionally as well as minimal and abstract photography in an artistic capacity.
		 <br>When collaborating with you, I strive for unique, beautiful images presented honestly with no Photoshop fakeness. I am able to work with digital, 35mm film as well as medium format film to provide a variety of looks and aesthetics to your imagery depending on your needs. Services I offer are, but not limited to; individual and family photo sessions, event coverage, look books, blog content, weddings and engagements. </p>
